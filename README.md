# Rotary-Encoder-code-to-set-PCR-reaction-parameter
This is the the Arduino code for PCR reaction parameter setup. like you can change and set the temperature and time paramter using rotary encoder and also you can change number of cycle which we want to set. we can also select the menu for user define all paramter or default parameter.

Menu select
1)Default 
3)Setup

These are the setup parameter which also includes number of cycle
Temperature
1)Initial Denaturing
2)Denaturing
3)annealing
4)extention
5)Holding

Time
1)Initial Denaturing time
2)Denaturing time
3)annealing time
4)extention time
5)Holding time
